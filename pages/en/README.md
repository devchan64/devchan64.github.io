## 📌 Project Overview

This blog is a lightweight platform that combines a **static site generator** and **client-side rendering (CSR)**  
to enable **search, automated translation, and data visualization** — all with minimal server infrastructure.

> Designed as a _searchable archive of structured thinking_, this blog balances **scalability** and **maintenance-free operations**.

## 🎯 Architectural Choices

### ✅ Why Client-Side Rendering (CSR)?
- Enables interactive features like **Pagefind search**, views tracking, and dynamic translation
- Allows static content to support **real-time, on-demand interactions** without full server rendering

### ✅ Why Minimal Server Infrastructure?
- Built on **GitHub Pages** to reduce deployment and infrastructure complexity
- Uses **serverless APIs** (Supabase, OpenAI) for dynamic features
- Eliminates the need to maintain any custom server

## ✨ Key Features

### ✅ Markdown-Based Content Management
- Blog posts are stored in the `_posts/` folder
- Metadata handled via YAML frontmatter (`title`, `tags`, `date`, `lang`, etc.)

### 🌍 OpenAI-Powered Auto Translation
- Translates long posts in section-sized chunks to reduce truncation
- Translated files saved under `_posts/en/`
- Supports both changed-post updates and full English regeneration via GitHub Actions
- Manual workflow runs can control repair scope with `flagged_order`, `repair_limit`, and `full_regeneration`

### 📈 Supabase-Based Page View Tracking
- Tracks views by page slug using Supabase as backend
- Secure with RLS (Row-Level Security) policies
- Future plan: Add dashboard visualization

### ⚙️ GitHub Actions Automation
- End-to-end CI/CD for build, deploy, translation, and PR creation
- Minimal manual work required → maximizes **sustainability and automation**
