# Guide to Process Transition for Startups

# Why is Process Transition Important for Startups?

The strength of startups lies in rapid execution. However, non-repetitive execution leads to chaos, and execution without feedback does not lead to growth.  
For sustainable growth, it is necessary to recognize repetition, structure it, define it in executable terms, and realize it on a digital foundation.

This document is based on the following philosophy:

> "Identify repetition, define it by seven criteria, and it becomes a process.  
> When DX (Digital Transformation) philosophy is added, it becomes the structure of a learning organization."

# 1. Recognize Repetition

Processes do not arise from simple repetition of actions.  
**When exchanges of ideas repeat**, that is, the same questions, the same explanations, the same adjustments are repeated, it signals the need for structure.

- Are you repeatedly explaining the same content?
- Are you continually answering similar questions?
- Is the context you provided often misunderstood or rearranged?

Such repetitions are not just inefficiencies, they are warnings that **communication costs are accumulating**.  
What is needed then is not human patience, but a **structured way of delivery**.

> However, even if it repeats, if there is no communication or exchange of ideas, there is no reason to turn it into a process.  
> Processes exist for structured communication.  
> Repetition without communication is just a personal habit.

---

# 2. Structure It

Once you have recognized the repetition, you need to structure it into a process using **seven criteria**.  
These criteria are not just frameworks for documentation, but the backbone of exchanges meant to facilitate communication.

## Criterion 1: When does it start? (Trigger)

- Does it start when a request is received?
- Does it start every Monday at 10 AM?
- Does it automatically execute when a specific event occurs?

→ Clear starting conditions for the process allow anyone to predict and respond.

## Criterion 2: How often does it repeat? (Cycle)

- Is it a one-time occurrence?
- Is it a structure that repeats periodically?
- Does it occur irregularly depending on conditions?

→ Clarifying the repetition cycle lays the foundation for resource planning and automation.

## Criterion 3: Who creates the Context? (Context Author)

> Note: The reason for using the word Context here is to indicate a flexible and sufficient unit that conveys **intent, premises, background, and purpose** along with simple information or explanations.  
> Embracing undefined variety while securing the possibility of judgment is the essence of Context.

- The Context Author is not the executor but plays a role in forming a judicable context and clearly conveying it so that it can lead to the next step.

## Criterion 4: Standardization of Context (Context Template)

- It is inefficient if the criteria for forming Context change each time.
- Create a Context Template to use a standardized template for repeated feedback.
- The Context Author uses this template to deliver the necessary context quickly and clearly.
- This reduces communication errors and increases efficiency.

## Criterion 5: Context Receiver

- The person receiving the Context is not just a recipient of information but reviews the information and provides necessary feedback.
- This person decides whether the received Context can move to the next step and requests additional information or adjustments if needed.
- The process of providing feedback is not just about giving precise instructions but about providing additional information and reviews for alignment.

## Criterion 6: Standardization of Feedback (Feedback Template)

- Feedback is not just a reaction but a **process of adjustment and alignment**.  
Using a feedback template provides a consistent feedback structure and ensures each feedback contributes to achieving goals.

### Feedback Status Types

> Note: Bureaucracies use 'approve/reject/supplement,' but in a startup environment, maintaining alignment and flow is key.

- Next Step Ready: Ready to proceed to the next step immediately
- Needs Clarification: Needs additional explanation due to insufficient information
- Needs Alignment: Needs alignment with higher intent or flow
- On Hold: Judgment paused, waiting due to external issues

## Criterion 7: What flow does it go through? (Flow)

What stages does this process go through?

### Flow Example: Ordering Process

| Stage  | Description | Main Activities and Decisions |
|-------|------|------------------|
| 1. Context (Order Creation)  | The orderer defines the necessary products, quantity, delivery date, etc., in an **order form**. | - Prepare the order form and get ready to deliver to the order receiver |
| 2. Delivery (Order Delivery) | The orderer delivers the order form to the order receiver. | - Deliver order form content, order receiver reviews and checks stock status |
| 3. Response (Feedback after stock check) | After checking the stock, the order receiver provides feedback to the orderer. | - If stock is available, confirm order and notify of shipping schedule<br>- Suggest alternative products if stock is insufficient |
| 4. Processing (Order Confirmation and Execution) | The order receiver confirms the order and instructs the logistics team to prepare for shipment. | - Instruct logistics team after order confirmation<br>- Check incoming schedule for insufficient stock and notify of alternative products |
| 5. Record (Order Processing Completion)  | Once the order is completed, the order record is reflected in the system. | - Record the order in the system and refer to it for future order processes |

**All stages must be specified**, so anyone can follow this flow and execute the correct process accurately.

# 3. Make It a Process

Repetition and structure alone do not complete a process.  
**Context, feedback, and flow must be connected** for it to become an executable process.

- Have you captured a repeating situation?
- Have you structured that repetition?
- Who creates the context, who responds, and how is it connected to the next step?

When all these are connected,  
anyone can execute and improve upon the process.

> Processes take repetition from being 'someone's tacit knowledge' and turn it into an **explicit asset used by the organization**.

---

# 4. Embed the Digital Way

Digital transformation is not just about adopting tools.  
It is about changing the philosophy to systematize repetition, structure records, and make feedback traceable.

Digital is not merely a means for speed.  
Rather, it creates an environment where **the structure remembers** and **the flow automatically continues**, not people.

- Repetitive actions are turned into templates.
- Flows are visualized so that anyone can understand them.
- Execution and feedback are connected to collaboration tools to be traceable.
- The system, not human memory, should be able to reproduce the structure.

> Digital transformation should first involve designing the structure before the technology.  
> When technology is applied on top of that structure, the process truly comes alive.

# Conclusion

Startups need to execute quickly.  
However, even in this speed, we must always ask:

- What are we repeating?
- Who is executing these repetitions, and in what context?
- Is there feedback? Is the flow being shared?

If you can clearly answer these questions,  
that organization is already transitioning from merely executing to being a structured organization that learns and evolves.

> Define the repetition.  
> Clearly identify who creates and who responds to the Context.  
> Then, connect that flow with a digital structure.
>
> Organizations create structures not to explain to people,  
> but so that people naturally learn within those structures.  
> Then onboarding is no longer a lecture,  
> but a process of engaging people in a 'living structure'.
