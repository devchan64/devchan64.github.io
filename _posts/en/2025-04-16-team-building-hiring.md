# Structuring a Development Organization by Domain and Designing Recruitment Criteria: A Case Study

This case study describes structuring the development organization by domain **and designing recruitment criteria and interview flows** for launching a new service. It was a process of **completing a flow that could solve problems with people, not just hiring technicians**.

---

## Problem Recognition

The company wanted to implement an unmanned strategy, but  
**there was no dedicated development organization to handle this internally**,  
and it wasn't even clear what roles were necessary.  
Hiring without clear job definitions was seen as a limitation to embedding technology within the organization as it expanded.

---

## My Design Philosophy

I view recruitment not as "selecting people" but as  
**a design task that completes structures capable of solving problems with people**.  
More important than technical skills is  
**the mindset that understands the business context and can resolve it through technology**.

---

## Design Direction

- **Structuring the organization into 4 domains**  
  → Service Platform / Data Platform / Devices / Operations

- **Analyzing external cases and job definitions to reconstruct roles that fit our business**  
  → Reconstructing JDs to align with **our strategy instead of existing market definitions**

- **Formalizing interview structures and evaluation criteria**  
  → Modularizing repetitive questions and focusing on problem-solving rather than just technical skills

- **Designing the flow including onboarding structure post-recruitment**  
  → Structuring systems to ensure alignment with strategic growth even after joining

---

## Results

- Placement of several talents into appropriate domains based on role definitions
- Acquisition of technical talent based on understanding of business
- Completion of dedicated development organization → Foundation for internalization of technology
- Flexible redeployment possible in future service expansions due to domain-centric organizational structure

## In Summary

A technology organization is not made up solely of technology.  
**Proper role definitions, context-focused evaluation criteria, and a structured onboarding process are necessary for technology to truly integrate within the organization.**

Our team was completed over about **6 months, and launched its first service to the market just 4 months later**.

- From service development
- Contracts with third-party suppliers,
- Designing operational agency processes,
- To the flow of customer delivery, everything was internally concluded.

As a result, about 150 customers were able to directly experience our service. Although not a massive growth, the entire process of recognizing the problem, structuring, and executing in such a short time was considered a meaningful achievement.

From this experience, I am convinced that **a technology organization can also be designed like a platform**.

Going forward, I plan to spend most of my time designing people and structures before adopting technology.
